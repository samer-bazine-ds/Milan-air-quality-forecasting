# Milan Air Quality Forecasting

This project aims to forecast air pollution levels in the city of **Milan, Italy**, using machine learning. Milan's air quality is influenced by its geographic location in the **Po Valley**, surrounded by the Alps and Apennines, leading to pollutant accumulation due to low wind dispersion.

##  Objectives
- Collect and preprocess air pollution data for Milan.
- Explore pollutant behavior and patterns.
- Forecast future pollution levels using machine learning / statistical models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Ridg, etc.)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly
- Jupyter / Google Colab

## üìä Pollution Indicators

The pollutants analyzed  include:
- PM2.5
